# SCDV490-FinalProject-BlakeRivers

## Description
Blake Rivers' Final Project for SCDV490.  Focusing on United States Census Data through the years.
Looking at the change in different demographics of states over the years and some of the causes behind those changes.

#### Plans of Project are to:
- Look at the Change in Population vs Change In Income by state 
- Find clusters of states that are similiar to each other
- Do a clustering algorithm on them that clusters similiar ones together
- Talk about the states that get clustered together and similarites between them
